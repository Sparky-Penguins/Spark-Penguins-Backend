To build this project first make sure you have node installed, then install of the following 
dependencies: {
    "axios": "^1.8.2",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.2"
}

now just run node server.js and it will run the server on localhost:3232

Then go to https://github.com/Sparky-Penguins/sparky-penguins.github.io and dowload the main website code then replace const serverURL in index.html with 
what ever the end point for the server so if your running this locally change it to localhost:3232
